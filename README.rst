Prestans 3 is a ground up reboot of our originally published `REST framework <https://github.com/anomaly/prestans.git>`_ with efforts concentrated towards: 

- `Great software development habits, <https://anomaly.net.au/blog/new-years-resolutions-for-2016/>`_ with a formalised process for requesting changes
- Redesigned syntax that much more pleasing to use
- Complete allegiance to the WSGI and HTTP standards
- Enhancing security by splitting our developer tools out of the main repository
- Streamlining our documentation including `docstrings`
- Preparing for the future that Python 3 brings

Prestans 3 is currently undergoing *aggressive development* and will eventually be available via `PyPi` as `prestans3` and will be backwards incompatible with Prestans 2 APIs. 

We encourage you to join `our list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/presntas3-discuss>`_ and share any ideas or feature requests.

**Note:** Please do not attempt to use Prestans 3 at the moment, your REST API won't work :-)
